## Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is a type of AI that gives machines the ability not only to read human language, but also to understand and interpret it. NLP allows machines to understand written and spoken text and perform tasks such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.

## Sentinment Analysis
Sentiment analysis uses NLP and ML to interpret and analyze the sentiment of subjective data such as news articles and tweets. You can identify positive, negative, and neutral opinions to determine how your customers feel about your brand, product, or service. Sentiment analysis is used to assess public opinion, monitor brand reputation, and better understand customer experience.Â
